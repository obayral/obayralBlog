      After my graduation, I commenced my career as a Management Trainee in ICBC(Turkey) Bank in October 2016. 
      From October to November, 2016 I had been trained in this program in order to be acquainted with the units in a bank and to be introduced with the global banking system. 
      After successfully completing this program I began to my duty in Information Technologies Department and I was responsible for developing projects for the Web Branch, Call Center Module and Fraud Module. 
      Furthermore, I developed work flow projects for Board of Auditors and Internal Audit Departments.In September 2017, I was sent to China in order to learn an internal software program and assist to a project between Turkey and China. It was an incredible experience and way beyond
      my expectations. In ICBC, I have implemented lots of projects, and some of them are like below: 
      <br>

      <br>
      <b>SWIFT Transfer:</b> SWIFT is one of the most important and popular ways of transferring money globally. To this end,
      I have developed a project for the internet branch of ICBC Turkey in order to enable the customer to transfer money internationally.
      <br><br>
      <b>Blocked User Instant Notification System:</b> Implemented an instant notification system for the Retail Banking Department in
      order to contact with the customers who have blocked their accounts by entering
      their passwords or SMS passwords 3 times in a row. 
      <br><br>
      <b>Inspection Information System:</b> Developed a work flow project on Atlassian JIRA in order to enable the
      Department of Inspection Board to create and trace the findings of the bank
      electronically. In this context, process of creating, examining, taking action, and
      closing of findings was eased.

      Also here are some good memories of my ICBC experience.<br>
